# IT Committee Handbook

The St. Paul IT Committee (the “Committee”) is a collective group of community members and stakeholders who serve in a specialized capacity to advise, assist, and facilitate decisions approved by the active Principle of St. Paul (the “Principle”) on Information Technology (“IT”) matters of St. Paul. This Committee Handbook (the “Handbook”) has been developed to provide general guidelines about Committee policies and operating procedures for Committee members. It is a guide to assist in becoming familiar with some of the privileges and obligations of membership, including the Committeeʹs policy of voluntary membership. The personnel polices of the Committee are established by the Principle. The Principle may, in turn, delegate authority for administering specific policies to committee members at the Principle’s discretion.

These guidelines are subject to modification, amendment or revocation by a majority of members of the Committee and approval by the Principle at any time. Committee members are encouraged to consult the Principle for additional information regarding the policies, procedures, and privileges described in this Handbook. The Committee will provide each individual a copy of this Handbook upon membership approval. All members are expected to abide by it. The highest standards of personal and professional ethics and behavior are expected of all Committee members. Further, the Committee expects each member to display good judgment, diplomacy, and courtesy in their professional relationships with members of the Committee, faculty/staff of St. Paul, and the general public.

## Values
The Committee shall operate under, uphold, and outwardly demonstrate the Committee’s Core Values (the “Values”). In all aspects of participation in the Committee, these Values must be actively practiced to provide the best possible experiences with those we encounter.

The Values of the Committee are:

- **Empathy.** Let’s put people first.
- **Governance.** Serve St. Paul through standards, patterns, roles, and executive sponsorship.
- **Collaboration.** The best work is done together.
- **Positive Impact.** Make the St. Paul world a better place.
- **Transparency.** Work in an open way.

If any of these Values are not being demonstrated, the Principle can use their discretion in deciding upon the violator's continued membership in the Committee.

## Membership
Membership in the Committee is voluntary and each member reserves the right to step down at any time by meeting with the Principle and coming to an agreement together. In addition, if a member is found to continuously violate the policies of the handbook and/or willingly not uphold the Committee’s Values, the Principle may choose to remove the member and their recognition as being a member will no longer persist. Access to passwords, secrets, and tokens will be revoked, and the Principle will decide on the former member’s participation in other communication and collaboration channels.

There may be up to seven (7) members serving in an official capacity of the Committee, but members must be appointed by the Principle and recognized by existing members of the Committee.

## Communication and Collaboration
A critical component to the success of the Committee is well-established communication and collaboration channels. Different channels are required for appropriate operation of a professional IT organization, such as the Committee. Communication will happen in these channels unless another is formally recognized by the Principle and the Committee, and by these channels, collaboration can thrive. The tenants of successful, effective communication and collaboration include (but is not limited to):

1. **Asynchronous communication.** Electronic chat in a persistent chat room is proven to be the most effective means of communication. A few reasons for this include:
	- Participants can join the conversation when they are available, they don’t have to step out of a classroom or meeting to join
	- Participants can see other’s conversations and benefit from the lessons learned
	- You do not need to wait for a formal meeting to introduce new topics to participants
	- Accomplishes transparency: Nearly 100% of IT-related conversations can be held in the open, the entire IT industry is adopting this method of communication
	- Accessible via desktop workstation, or mobile device
2. **Synchronous communication.** Includes holding officially scheduled meetings between participants. These are useful for specific, focused decisions that cannot be done over the asynchronous communication channel and must be kept to a minimum. A downside to this method is, if it is a decision that can be made over the asynchronous communication channel, then time between idea-to-decision is unnecessarily increased, as the Committee must wait until the meeting to conclude the conversation.
3. **Documented decisions and approvals.** It is appropriate to document all decisions and approvals. This is necessary for record keeping and future auditing.
4. **Historical references that are searchable.** The importance of communication and collaboration does not end at how active conversations are held. It is extended to how easy past conversations are referenced. It is not possible for any one Committee member to be available 100% of the time, therefore, searching past conversations is a greatly valued trait of the Committee.
5. **Persistent conversations, decisions, and approvals.** Not only are historical and past conversations important for reference and future decision making, but it is important the business system in which these artifacts are stored on be supported in a persistent manner so its history is never altered.
6. **Password, Secret, and Token Management.** It is not appropriate to store these artifacts in plain text. It is also necessary to make these artifacts available to members of the Committee as well as the Principle. For all passwords, secrets, and tokens, use an officially-supported password-management tool that encrypts the values and is accessible by Committee members.
7. **Ad-hoc in-person conversations.** There are always appropriate times for these types of conversations to be held, such as a trivial question, quick fix to a maintenance issue, etc, however these should be kept at a minimum at the discretion of Committee members, since all faculty, staff, and other Committee members can benefit from nearly all instances of such conversations. That is to say, documenting a trivial question in one of the established communication channels can be searchable in the future by other personnel to potentially solve the same work item.
8. **External communication.** Not everyone can have access to internal communication channels. This is where email is most useful. When the Committee needs to send messages to outside entities, email is an excellent option.

With the Tenants of Communication and Collaboration defined above, we can begin to formally establish the Committee’s channels so each member can leverage them in an appropriate manner:

- **Flowdock**
	- Tenants addressed: 1,3,4,5
	- Description: Persistent, transparent chatroom-style collaboration. Alternative solution to Flowdock is [Slack](https://www.slack.com).
	- Advantages: Asynchronous communication most effective form of collaboration. In addition, easy access via mobile device.
	- Disadvantages: Threaded conversations can be a challenge, but not a show-stopper.
- **GitHub**
	- Tenants addressed: 1,3,4,5
	- Description: Artifact, work-item style collaboration in the context of St. Paul.
	- Advantages: Keep track of projects and milestones easily, including IT work items and Website redesign. Share code and keep track of changes in a simple way. Send collaborators direct links to content quickly. History is never removed. Free for public repositories. Know when content of artifacts are changed or altered.
	- Disadvantages: Free for public repositories only. This means we should not place sensitive content in the repositories, however general IT-related matters would be acceptable.
- **Email**
	- Tenants addressed: 8
	- Description: Standard email service via `@stpaulthorndale.com` email address(es).
	- Advantages: Can hold private conversations for personal or sensitive material.
	- Disadvantages: Only specific personnel (i.e the sender and those in the To/Cc/Bcc fields) can benefit from the conversation. Nearly all conversations on IT-related matters should be held in a transparent way. Only discuss sensitive or personal matters via email. Flowdock can also have 1-on-1 conversations.
- **1Password**
	- Tenants addressed: 6
	- Description: Simple password manager. Contains miscellany passwords, secrets, and tokens, including credentials to common business or service accounts.
	- Advantages: Intuitive interface, excellent support, seamless desktop/workstation/mobile device experience, and synchronization between Committee members.
	- Disadvantages: Slightly confusing identification of “Primary Vault” during initial setup.
- **In-person chatter**
	- Tenants addressed: 7
	- Description: Casual and unofficial chatter in the hallway.
	- Advantages: Easy to address trivial questions and issues that may arise, in which the resolution can be identified quickly.
	- Disadvantages: Cannot address IT-related matters during timeframes where other official business is being held, such as official working hours for volunteers or during classroom teaching time. Also, conversations held off-cycle are not discoverable for other committee members.
- **Ad-hoc and formal meetings**
	- Tenants addressed: 2,7
	- Description: Traditional, scheduled meetings between Committee members, the Principle, and/or other St. Paul stakeholders.
	- Advantages: Discuss and come to agreements on major decisions when needed. A record must be in a written/typed/electronic format, such as via the usage of meeting minutes or via a solution that addresses Communication and Collaboration tenants 3, 4, and/or 5.
	- Disadvantages: Often times, matters proposed for a synchronous meeting can be more effectively resolved via an asynchronous communication solution. Time can be wasted in the lead-up to the meeting time. Also, it can be difficult for all members to be available at a common time during and/or off of official, business working hours.

## Governance
The direction of decisions at St. Paul are led by the Principle as the authoritative representative of St. Paul, with guidance and facilitation by the Committee. This also includes the usage of IT and technology-related funds as defined at the previous budget meeting of the current fiscal year. It would not be appropriate for a minority of Committee members to have the ability to spend funds approved by the voting body of the church without approval by the Principle, especially because those funds extend to the Church as well. Therefore, it is important to set a policy on when approval by the Principle is required.

Items and activities that need approval by the Principle include:

- Approval of Fund Expenditures as per the approved budget line item for the current fiscal year titled “XXXX”
- Membership changes
- Decisions that affect the direction and sustainability of St. Paul
- Things that may also fall under the scope of the Trustees
	- Get approval by the head of Trustees

The St. Paul Church and School is a tightly integrated entity that supports each other in a very close way. Although the Committee reports to the Principle for IT-related matters and they primarily perform work for the School, the Committee is encouraged to help with IT-related matters of the Church with guidance from the Pastor. However, the policies in this Handbook must still be followed.

## Asset Ownership
Often times, business applications, solutions, or relationships with outside entities may require ownership by a representative or entity of St. Paul, and often times this situation occurs in the context of IT-related matters. This can include subscriptions to school-related educational material, licenses for IT solutions purchased by the Committee, and other related items. It is important to set a policy on how these relationships should exist for long-term sustainability and day-to-day operation of IT-related matters at St. Paul. This will also protect St. Paul in the event a license or subscription is owned by a named person (as opposed to a business or service account) and the status of that named person becomes such that they are no longer associated with St. Paul.

The official business/service account for such matters shall be the Google account `it@stpaulthorndale.com`.

- All future software and non-software related licenses and subscriptions should be acquired and subsequently owned by `it@stpaulthorndale.com`.
	- If this is not possible, the reasons should be clearly documented using an officially supported channel of communication.
- All current software and non-software related licenses and subscriptions not owned by `it@stpaulthorndale.com` shall be immediately transferred from the previous owner to `it@stpaulthorndale.com`.
	- If this is not possible, the reasons should be clearly documented using an officially supported channel of communication.
- Ownership is different than collaboration. While licenses and subscriptions should be owned by the business/service account, named collaborators can and should be added to those assets so changes can be tracked and credited to specific people.

## SOX Compliance
TBD. Who needs to achieve SOX compliance? Definition of SOX and various implementations. Traceability.
